<p>Coffee is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation">brewed</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink">drink</a> prepared from roasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean">coffee beans</a>, the seeds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry#Modified_berries">berries</a> from certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea"> Coffea </a> species. The genus <i class="plants"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea"> Coffea </a> </i> is native to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Africa"> tropical Africa </a> (specifically having its origin in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia"> Ethiopia </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"> Sudan </a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar"> Madagascar </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoros"> the Comoros </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius"> Mauritius </a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Réunion"> Réunion </a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean"> the Indian Ocean </a>. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_coffee_production"> 70 countries </a>, primarily in the equatorial regions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas"> Americas </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"> Southeast Asia </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent"> Indian subcontinent </a>, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"><i class="type of coffee">C. arabica</i></a> and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee"> <i class="type of coffee">C. robusta </i> </a>. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting"> roasted </a> to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation"> brewed </a> with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.</p>

<p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid">acidic</a> and has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant">stimulating</a> effect in humans, primarily due to its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine">caffeine</a> content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso">espresso</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press">French</a> press, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte">café latte</a>). It is usually served hot, although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iced_coffee">iced coffee</a> is a popular alternative. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are of generally poor quality.</p>

<p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen">Yemen</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Arabia">southern Arabia</a> in the middle of the 15th century in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism">Sufi</a> shrines. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is now prepared. But the coffee seeds had to be first exported from East Africa to Yemen, as the Coffea arabica plant is thought to have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_plant">indigenous</a> to the former. Yemeni traders took coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century, the drink had reached<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"> Persia </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"> Turkey </a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa"> North Africa </a>. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.<p/>
